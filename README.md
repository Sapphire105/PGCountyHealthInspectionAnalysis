# Prince George's County Health Inspection Data Analysis

In this notebook, we will be analysing the data of health inspections of various establishments across PG County in Maryland (this is where I live lol). 
We will be basing the analysis on specific questions related to processing and plotting the data.
For this analysis, numpy, pandas, datetime, and re libraries are used for data manipulation while matplotlib and seaborn libraries are used for visualizations.

PS: Used plotly to make a really cool interactive map plot. Having trouble with rendering so added the screenshots in a separate file.
